# cs50exploit
Stuxnet or possibly better or just a sample on your own computer(s) taught in CS50

This repository is not officially affiliated or licensed by the CS50 class at Harvard University in any way ðŸ˜…
But Github had to ban me for emailing Twitch some of their very obvious criminal violations so I couldn't complete the final project for CS50P ðŸ˜›
So I decided to retake CS50 and will sort of retake sort of do CS50AI etc and create a cs50exploit class to teach, and hopefully pass the free online versions (with paid optional certificate) at some point ðŸ˜˜
